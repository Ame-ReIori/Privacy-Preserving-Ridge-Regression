# Modules folder

Inside this modules folder we wrote some small codes snippets to start playing around with the different frameworks we were going to work with.

- the `ABY/` folder contains several examples of codes snippets using the ABY framework in C++.
- the `cholesky/` folder contains our decomposed implementation of Cholesky decomposition in Python (used before implementation in ABY).
- the `pailler/` folder contains examples of code using the phe python module.
- the `regression/` folder contains a clear text version of our ridge regression code to compare our result with the final privacy preserving version.

Hope this helps and have fun.
