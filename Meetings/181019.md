## What we talked about :
- The main technologies of the paper (Homomorphic encryption, Yao’s garbled circuits…)
- The two protocols discussed in the paper (with and without decryption inside the circuit)

## Topics to work on and discuss next week : 
- Start to experiment with Pailler (see what open source options we have)
- Try and implement a non encrypted data ridge regression algorithm (find a dataset on UCI)

## References discussed :
