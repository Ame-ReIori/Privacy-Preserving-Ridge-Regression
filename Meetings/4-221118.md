# 22/11/18 Semester Project Meeting (4)

## What we did before the meeting:
- chose to work on ABY because of the functionalities and the documentation
- implemented E(A+μA) and E(b+μb) without encrypting μA and μb
- tried to compile ABY and write small codes
- looked at paillier's security parameters

## What we need to do for next time:
- still need to test code with simple datasets (with integer values) and compare performance
- compile ABY with a docker
- look for equivalent of cholesky
- read the end of the paper again to look for details on how to convert code into a circuit
- compile a simple ABY code and prepare a demo for next time
