# 06/12/18 Semester Project Meeting (6)

## What we did before the meeting:
- Worked a lot on the implementation of ABY in our case scenario (ABY now works with floating point numbers).
- Implemented the matrix substraction inside the circuit to remove the mask (muA, muB).
- Started to implement Cholesky decomposition inside the circuit.
- Didn't manage to import square root from ABY library so decided to approximate a square root using the Babylonian method.

## What we need to do for next time:
- Continue our implementation of Cholesky in ABY (and debug it).
- Update Readme to explain structure and compilation of our code.
