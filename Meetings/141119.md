# 14/11/18 Semester Project Meeting (3)

## Questions to ask :
- Can we have access to an ssh machine in Eurecom? (To implement YAO in C)
- Do we have to do the uniformization of the inputs/outputs? (why?)
- How do we calculate the error in our model? Why is the error so bad? (look at the code all together)

## What we talked about :
- We've cut the datasets into two sets : one training set and one test set
- Added a few other datasets (forestfires, concrete strenght, CPU power...)
- Started to play arround with ABY in C++ / discovered Pygarbled
- Implemented protocol 2 with paillier up to the point where we use garble circuits


## Topics to work on and discuss next week : 

- Do we need to uniformize the inputs/outputs ?
- Do we need to implement sockets for a multiparty computations or can we do everything inside the code with private/public variables ?
- How to calculate the error ? Divided by what ? (abs(sum(predicted-original))/a) a=mean?
