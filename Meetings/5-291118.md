# 29/11/18 Semester Project Meeting (5)

## What we did before the meeting:
- compiled ABY in a virtual environment (a docker container) to be able to have the same compilation environment during our development phase
- worked with ABY, getting familiar with simple arithmetic gates on choosen values
- worked with SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) to optimize the code
- did the first step of matrix substration in a YAO circuit using SIMD gates
- searched a optimized version of cholesky, decomposed the algorithm as much as possible - using a list of numbers a not a numpy array

## What we need to do for next time:
- Approximation method of square root
- Try again to implement PutFPGate again to manipulate floating point numbers in ABY (especially Square root gate)
