#25/10/18 Semester Project Meeting (2)

#What we did before the meeting:
- discovered a paillier library in python (phe): wrote a code in which we encrypt numbers and perform linear operations on them.
- tried to write a linear regression starting from X and Y: computation of A and b, cholesky decompostition and back substitution to retrieve beta.
- test our code with a data set from UCI (forestfires)
- looked at ABY opensource project on github: https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY 

##What we need to do for next time:
- separate our data set into 2: training set and test set (80/20%).
- test our result by recomputing A*beta=b
- normalize inputs on [-1,1] range
- try to understand the meaning of beta
- continue checking ABY
- check the code with another data set from UCI
